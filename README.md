# DataverseCustomApis

## Introduction
Following the latest announcements about the end of life of Custom Activities, Microsoft has announced a new feature called Custom API.

If you want to understand how to create a Custom API you can refer to the following link:

## Project Description

Based on the legendary project of Demian Adolfo Raschkovan (https://github.com/demianrasko/Dynamics-365-Workflow-Tools), I wanted to use the same concept but with the latest features.
This project is meant to be evolutionary!
