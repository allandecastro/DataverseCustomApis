# DataverseCustomApis

## Introduction

Following the latest announcements about the end of life of Custom Activities, Microsoft has announced a new feature called Custom API.
This is intended to replace Customs Activities but involves a few additional steps to introduce it, notably by creating a new type of solutio-aware component : Custom API, Custom API Request Parameter and Custom API Response Property.
If you want to understand how to create a Custom API you can refer to the following link:

### Disclaimer 
> Custom API functionality is still considered as a Preview feature. While unlikely, some breaking changes might occur and will be fixed ASAP.

Here is the link to the Dataverse Custom API's [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/custom-api)

## Project Description

Based on the legendary project of Demian Adolfo Raschkovan (https://github.com/demianrasko/Dynamics-365-Workflow-Tools), I wanted to use the same concept but with the latest features.
This project is intended to evolve!
